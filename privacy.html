  <h1 class="legal-title">Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="legal-updated">Last updated: June 2025</p>

  <div class="legal-section">
    <p>At Neatmark, we take your privacy seriously. This page explains what information we collect when you use our client intake form, how we use it, and how we protect it. We have written this in plain language on purpose. You deserve to know exactly what happens with your data, without having to decode legal jargon.</p>
  </div>

  <hr class="legal-divider">

  <div class="legal-section">
    <h2>What information we collect</h2>
    <p>When you fill out and submit the Neatmark client intake form, we collect the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your full name</li>
      <li>Your email address</li>
      <li>Your brand or business name</li>
      <li>Your preferred delivery timeframe</li>
      <li>Your answers to the brand questionnaire, including any written descriptions, preferences, and uploaded inspiration images</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not collect any payment information, identification documents, or sensitive personal data through this form.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="legal-section">
    <h2>How we use your information</h2>
    <p>The information you share with us is used for one purpose only: to understand your brand needs so we can do our best work for you. Specifically, your submission helps us prepare for your project kickoff, tailor our design approach to your vision, and keep a record of your brief throughout the collaboration.</p>
    <p>We do not use your information for marketing campaigns, analytics profiling, or any automated decision-making. We do not send you unsolicited emails based on your submission beyond what is directly related to your project with us.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="legal-section">
    <h2>We do not sell or share your data</h2>
    <p>Your information is never sold to third parties. We do not work with advertising networks, data brokers, or third-party marketing services of any kind. Your submission is not used to build advertising profiles, and it is not shared with anyone outside of the Neatmark team.</p>
    <p>The only time we would share information is if we were legally required to do so by a court order or applicable law, which we would only comply with to the extent necessary.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="legal-section">
    <h2>Who can access your data</h2>
    <p>Your submission is stored securely in a private database. Only authorized Neatmark administrators can access the dashboard where submissions are stored. No client can see another client's submission. Access is protected by authentication and is limited to team members who need it to manage your project.</p>
    <p>Your inspiration images and any uploaded files are stored in a private, access-controlled storage system. Direct links to your files are not publicly guessable or indexable.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="legal-section">
    <h2>How we protect your data</h2>
    <p>We take reasonable technical and organizational steps to keep your information safe. Our database and file storage are hosted on platforms that use industry-standard encryption at rest and in transit. Access credentials are kept private and are not shared outside the Neatmark team.</p>
    <p>While no system on the internet can be guaranteed 100% secure, we do our best to make sure your data is handled responsibly.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="legal-section">
    <h2>Draft saving in your browser</h2>
    <p>The form uses your browser's local storage to automatically save your answers as you type, so you don't lose your work if you close the tab. This data lives entirely in your own browser and is never sent to our servers until you press Submit. You can clear your saved draft at any time using the Clear Draft button in the form.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="legal-section">
    <h2>How long we keep your data</h2>
    <p>We keep your submission for as long as it is relevant to your project and our working relationship. If you would like your information removed from our records at any point, just send us an email and we will take care of it promptly.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="legal-section">
    <h2>Your rights</h2>
    <p>You have the right to ask us what data we hold about you, request a correction if anything is inaccurate, and ask us to delete your data. To exercise any of these rights, reach out to us directly at the contact details on our website. We will respond as quickly as we can.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="legal-section">
    <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
    <p>If we make any meaningful changes to how we handle your data, we will update this page and revise the date at the top. We will not retroactively apply practices that are materially worse than what was in place when you submitted your form.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="legal-section">
    <h2>Questions</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions about this policy or about how your data is handled, please reach out through our website at <a href="https://neatmark.studio" target="_blank">neatmark.studio</a>. We are happy to talk through anything that is unclear.</p>
