After: they gain marketable, high-paying skills, build additional income streams, and sustain their trading journey long-term — through real education, not noise.","A 20-year-old seeking real, practical ways to make money online — someone who values substance over hype and wants tangible, high-income skills rather than empty promises or quick-fix signals.","TRW (Hustlers University) is the closest business model reference — strong teaching methods and clear positioning. Coursera is in the same niche but doesn't address real income generation for the target audience.

Brands to avoid resembling: the forex/trading signal community in general — their identities are generic, outdated, and symbol-heavy (profit arrows, candle charts, winning trophies). No meaning, no differentiation. 3008 University should look nothing like that world.","Confident — some may read it as arrogant, but it's unapologetic conviction in the value delivered. The brand is serious and direct, leaning clean and minimal over expressive. It sits in a balanced space between approachable and authoritative. Core values: accessibility, quality delivery, and client experience. The personality is that of a bold mentor — someone who speaks with authority but genuinely wants others to succeed.","We are the only online university that provides high-paying skills through structured, outcome-driven education programs.",Me / myself,,"Nike (Just Do It) / Coursera (Learn Without Limits) / TRW (Escape The Matrix) / Udemy (Be Able) / BMW (The Ultimate Driving Machine) — all admired for strong, purposeful messaging and clean premium identities.","{""Deep & moody"",""Monochrome""}","Avoid anything cheap, flashy, or overly saturated — no neons or bright vivid tones. Deep blue is preferred and should anchor the palette; any direction that undermines a premium, serious feeling should be avoided.","{""Luxury & refined"",""Tech-forward""}","Typography: geometric sans-serif for body and UI, with a condensed display typeface for headlines — modern, strong, and commanding. The brand environment feels like a high-end, minimal office: clean white space, soft lighting, computer workstations, a meeting table with a large screen, and a coffee corner. The visual identity should carry that same controlled, premium energy throughout.",No existing assets to preserve — open to a completely fresh visual identity built from the ground up.,"{""Logo variations"",""Color & typography"",""Brand guidelines"",""Social media"",""Packaging""}",Best possible result no matter the cost,,Main focus right now is scaling this brand through personal branding and monetization. The three-year vision: compete with the biggest e-learning platforms in the niche and become the number one online education brand in North Africa.
